# Yoda Wallpaper

A minimal Yoda-themed wallpaper.
Wallpapers ready to go in PNG format can be found in `wallpapers` (only have jpg's made right now).

## How to Use
The main file here is the `yoda-wallpp.xcf`.
It's a GIMP image file that consists of layers which add the options for customization.
(For example, you can chose which quote you would like to show, which image to have in the corner, or even a different background.)
To create a wallpaper from using this project, it's easy:

1) Clone the repo.
2) Open the `yoda-wallpp.xcf` file in GIMP.
3) Use the layers to hide / show what you don't want / do want.
4) Export the image to a PNG (or whatever format you chose) and set as your wallpaper!

## License
I do not feel a need to attach a LICENSE to this project (I may in the future.)
Use it however you would like; just be cool and don't claim that it's yours.
